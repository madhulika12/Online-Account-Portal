               Under FCRA, you are entitled to obtain an annual free disclosure of your credit report from each of the national credit reporting agencies.

                  <strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHY?</strong>
                  <p>
                     We may collect personal information from which you can be identified, such as your name, date of birth, postal and e-mail address, phone number, national identifier or social security number (as applicable) and credit card details.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We will use this data to access and monitor various data sets that you request us to monitor as part of your identity protection service and for the prevention and detection of fraud. When you close your account, we may continue to share information about you according to our legal and regulatory requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We will use the information you provide us solely for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested and for administering our relationship with you, internal business purposes, our product or service development and/or statistical analysis.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>DO WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
                  <p>
                     We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<strong>We do not sell your personal information to, or share such personal information with, third parties for their promotional use or for marketing purposes.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In order for us to provide you with our identity protection service and for the prevention and detection of fraud, we will share your personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. Depending on the service you have requested, we may share your name, e-mail address, national identifier or social security number (as applicable), income, account balances, payment history and credit history with credit bureaus. We will also share your billing information with a credit card processing company in order to bill you for goods and services. These companies are authorized to use your personal information <em>only as necessary to provide </em>these services to us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     As may be required by law, we may also disclose your personal information, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a third party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by CSID will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?</strong>
                  <p>
                     We have appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures in place to protect your data when held by CSID that comply with relevant legal and best practice requirements. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card or social security number) as part of the enrollment process, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     When you submit information to CSID through our web site, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We will obtain assurances from any agents we may use to help provide this service that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy, which assurance will require the agent to provide the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles and the EU Data Protection Directive.

                  <strong>INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED FOR OUR CLIENTS</strong>
                  <p>
                     In most cases, CSID resells its services through its commercial clients (“Clients”). Accordingly, CSID does not have a direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes when CSID acts as a wholesaler of its services. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that resells our services, please contact the specific Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer your personal information to third parties who perform services on our behalf or help us provide our services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete enrollment data should direct his or her query to CSID’s Client (the data controller). If requested to edit enrollment data by our Client, we will respond within 30 days. In some cases, we will edit enrollment data on behalf of our Clients. When managing choice options on behalf of our Clients, we will also respond to any requests within 30 days. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. CSID will retain this personal information for so long as necessary to comply with our legal and audit obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements.

                  <strong>WILL WE SEND YOU OFFERS OF OTHER CSID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES?</strong>

                     Our range of identity protection products and services is constantly evolving to match the increasingly sophisticated market in which we operate. We will not send you details of other CSID products or services or those of any reputable third parties without your prior consent and you can change your mind at any time by contacting us.

                  <strong>ARE YOU VISITING OUR WEB SITE FROM A COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.)?</strong>
                  <p>
                     If you are visiting our web site from outside the United States, your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and CSID is based.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the “Safe Harbor Principles”) to enable U.S. companies, such as CSID, to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the E.U. to the United States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     CSID complies with the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  CSID has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The privacy principles below are based on the Safe Harbor Principles to ensure that when dealing with CSID you can be assured of the same levels of data protection that you enjoy in the E.U.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Note that certain information may be subject to policies of CSID that may differ in some minor respects from this Privacy Policy, in which case, these differences will have been highlighted to you when signing-up for our services.

            <strong>Important Credit Monitoring Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               Credit Monitoring (including TransUnion Credit Monitoring Basic, TransUnion Credit Monitoring, and other credit monitoring products offered on or through this site) is provided by TransUnion Interactive, Inc. Credit Monitoring monitors one or more of your credit files, depending upon the type of Credit Monitoring you purchase, which are separately owned and/or maintained by each of the applicable credit bureaus: TransUnion LLC, Experian, and Equifax. Credit Monitoring monitors the credit file most closely identified with you based on multiple identifying factors such as first, middle and last names, current and former addresses, Social Security number and date of birth. Credit Monitoring may not advise or alert you if an item of identifying information about you (including your name or address or Social Security number) is contained in the applicable credit bureau’s credit file of another person, and will not provide you with any information contained in another individual’s credit file. Credit Monitoring does not monitor, compare or cross-reference your credit file(s) with the credit files(s) of any other person.
            </p>
            <p>
               Please remember that there are different processing times for the commencement of monitoring at each credit reporting bureau, therefore you may not be enrolled in all of them at the same time. Monitoring with TransUnion LLC usually begins within 48 hours of enrollment. Monitoring with Equifax and Experian takes on average approximately 4 days to begin, though in some cases monitoring cannot be initiated during the trial period (if a trial period applies). TransUnion Interactive does not control and is not responsible for the enrollment process.
            </p>
            <p>
               Your order of any three bureau credit monitoring product is conditioned upon successful enrollment by at least one credit bureau in its credit monitoring product. If no credit bureau is able to enroll you in its credit monitoring program, your order will be cancelled, and you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to any of your credit files. In the event that one or two credit bureaus, but not all three bureaus, are able to enroll you in their credit monitoring, credit monitoring will be provided by the bureau or bureaus that were able to enroll you; you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to the credit files of the bureau or bureaus that were not able to enroll you in their respective credit monitoring programs.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the event you order a three-bureau credit monitoring product through this site (the “Site”), by placing your order, you agree that, if fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in their credit monitoring, TransUnion Interactive is authorized to monitor only the credit files at the bureau or bureaus that enrolled you. Any such credit monitoring will be provided at the price agreed upon; you will not be eligible for a price reduction, discount or refund. TransUnion Interactive will notify you in the event that fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in credit monitoring, but such notification may not occur during your trial period, if any.

               <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to obtain from each credit reporting agency a disclosure of all the information in your credit file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at a credit reporting agency must be obtained directly from such credit reporting agency. The credit reports provided or requested through our Site are not intended to constitute the disclosure of information by a credit reporting agency as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar laws.
            </p>
            <p>
               Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you are entitled to receive an annual free disclosure of your credit report from each of the national credit reporting agencies. For more information visit the credit report section in the Learning Center, available from most pages of the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from a credit reporting agency if:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               You have been denied or were otherwise notified of an adverse action related to credit, insurance, employment, or a government granted license or other government granted benefit within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.<br>
               You have been denied house/apartment rental or were required to pay a higher deposit than usually required within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.<br>
               You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment during the sixty (60) day period beginning on the date on which you made such certification.<br>
               You certify in writing that you are a recipient of public welfare assistance.<br>
               You certify in writing that you have reason to believe that your file at such credit reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud.<br>
               In addition, if you reside in the state of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or Vermont, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report once a year and if you reside in the state of Georgia, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report twice a year. Otherwise, a consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for providing you with a copy of your credit report.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides that you may dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit report. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PURCHASE YOUR CREDIT REPORT FROM TRANSUNION INTERACTIVE IN ORDER TO DISPUTE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT OR TO RECEIVE A COPY OF YOUR REPORT FROM EQUIFAX, EXPERIAN OR TRANSUNION, THE THREE NATIONAL CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES, OR FROM ANY OTHER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY.
            </p>
            <p>
               It may be the policies of Equifax, Experian and/or TransUnion to provide a complimentary copy of the consumer credit report under circumstances other than those described above. If you wish to contact Equifax, Experian or TransUnion to obtain a copy of your credit report directly from such agency or if you wish to dispute information contained in an Equifax, Experian or TransUnion credit report file, see the contact information and dispute process description contained in the Learning Center or from the inaccuracies tab on your credit report. The form of credit report and related disclosures provided directly by such agencies to you may differ from those provided by TransUnion Interactive.
